			<h3>Internet mail processing suite with SQLite backend</h3>
			cmail is an implementation of multiple protocols to fulfill most, if not all
			functions commonly expected in internet message exchange - commonly known as
			&quot;mail server&quot;.

		<div class="section">
			Architecturally, cmail is split into several modules which interface through a central SQLite database (the <a href="database.htm">master database</a>).
			For most modules, a command-line administration tool is provided.

			<h2>Development Rationale</h2>
			cmail was started out of resignation over the complexity involved in configuring and running
			many other MTAs. As such, the configuration file format is relatively simple and only affects
			the specifics of the module it is written for. For the most part the configuration files consist
			of directives specifying on which ports the module should provide its service.
	
			<p>
			The primary objective of the project is to provide an <a href="stepbystep.htm">easy-to-setup, 
			easy-to-configure</a> and secure mail server for end-users that simply want to send and receive 
			mails on their domains. Other use cases are, of course, supported, but not with as high a priority.
			</p>
			<p>
			The common configuration, such as local addresses, routing decisions and user data are kept in
			the master database. This provides flexibility of reconfiguration without restarting the modules,
			as well as allowing for the use of a variety of interfaces to configure the server, such as the
			provided Web Panel or an SQLite database editor.
			</p>
			<p>
			cmail was intentionally kept simple in terms of configuration as well as features. It might not
			support some features experienced administrators may be accustomed to out-of-the-box. 
			Most of it can probably be enabled or emulated with sufficient thought, though.
			</p>
			<p>
			Should that not be enough, you can extend cmail either by modyfing the purposely slim codebase or
			by interfacing with a (not yet implemented, but planned) internal API for modifying its behaviour
			with runtime-loaded shared libraries (plugins).
			</p>
			If cmail still does not meet your expectations after that, you might be better off using another
			MTA :)

			<h2>Current state &amp; coarse roadmap</h2>
			As the main developers have transitioned from university into full-time jobs, development has slowed
			somewhat. However, multiple cmail systems are in full productive use and the architecture has proven to be
			very stable. The primary criticism so far is missing support for IMAP, which is in slow progress,
			both due to the aforementioned lack of time as well as the pecularities of the IMAP protocol.
			<p>
			The following coarse roadmap illustrates the progress we currently aim for
			<ol>
				<li><i>cmail-imapd</i> Basic implementation (2019)</li>
				<li>Initial public packaged release (2019)</li>
			</ol>
			This listing should not be taken at face value. Development pace is not easy to estimate,
			and features may be postponed because of lack of interest or more pressing issues.
			<p>
			For finer grained To-Do lists, check the individual module folders in the repository
			for files named TODO.

			<h2>Common use cases</h2>

			<h3>Receive-only server, mail is sent via external servers</h3>
			The following modules are involved
			<ul>
				<li>cmail-smtpd for receiving incoming mail</li>
				<li>cmail-popd or cmail-imapd for access to mailboxes</li>
				<li>Optionally: cmail-api and cmail-webadmin for easier administration</li>
				<li>Optionally: cmail-api and cmail-webmailer for web access to mailboxes</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Send-only server</h3>
			This use case might be better served by <a href="http://untroubled.org/nullmailer/">nullmailer</a>. 
			Using cmail, you'd need
			<ul>
				<li>cmail-smtpd for accepting originated mail</li>
				<li>cmail-dispatchd for delivering the outbound mail</li>
				<li>Optionally: cmail-api and cmail-webadmin for easier administration</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Full-feature send- and receive-server</h3>
			This setup involves the following modules
			<ul>
				<li>cmail-smtpd for receiving incoming mail</li>
				<li>cmail-popd and/or cmail-imapd for access to mailboxes</li>
				<li>cmail-dispatchd for delivering the outbound mail</li>
				<li>Optionally: cmail-api and cmail-webadmin for easier administration</li>
				<li>Optionally: cmail-api and cmail-webmailer for web access to mailboxes</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Reasons for choosing cmail</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Easy setup</h3>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Easy configuration</h3>
				Mail server configuration is normally a task best left to experts. Feedback upon
				wrong configuration is scarce, and introducing security problems is easy.
				Configuration files for cmail modules are scarcely more than port bind directives
				and logging options, reducing the amount of things that can go wrong at module
				configuration time. Even at run-time, cmail makes it really hard to configure it
				to do dangerous things, such as presenting an open relay, while keeping it easy
				to add new addresses, domains and users.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Small codebase</h3>
				The cmail codebase is considerably smaller than that of most other MTAs, making it
				easier to understand, debug and fix problems that may arise.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Simple storage</h3>
			</div>
