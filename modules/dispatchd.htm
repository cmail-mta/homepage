			<h1>cmail-dispatchd</h1>
			<h3>Deliver outbound mail via SMTP</h3>
			This component delivers outbound mail to remote servers (and, in some cases, the local server)
			as well as generating bounce notification message upon failure of delivery.
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Building &amp; Prerequisites</h2>
			The following packages are required for building this module (Debian packages are listed)
			<ul>
				<li>libadns1-dev <i>(Used for resolving remote paths to mail servers)</i></li>
				<li>libgnutls28-dev <i>(Handling of TLS connections, not needed when compiling with <code>-DCMAIL_NO_TLS</code>)</i></li>
				<li>nettle-dev <i>(Cryptographic functions for password hashing)</i></li>
				<li>libsqlite3-dev <i>(Database interface)</i></li>
			</ul>

			A build of only this specific module can be initiated by running <code>make</code> in cmail-dispatchd/
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Setup information</h2>
			This module needs read and write access to the master database AS WELL AS the folder containing it.
			Recommended practice is creating a dedicated user and specifying that in the configuration in order to
			have the module drop its privileges after binding the ports.
			
			<p>
			Run the module without specifying a logfile in the configuration at first, in order to test its operation
			and track down any misconfigurations. Specifying a logfile allows the module to daemonize itself and detach
			from the starting shell.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Configuration file</h2>
			The configuration file contains multiple lines, each specifying one of the following configuration
			directives. Lines are read from this file consecutively. Most directives become active the moment 
			they are read. An example configuration file with sane defaults (save for the <code>announce</code>,
			<code>bounce_from</code> and <code>bind</code> options) can be found in the example-configs/ folder
			in the main repo.

					<td>
						<i>(optional)</i><br/>
						Bind address for outbound connections

					<td>
						Hosts with multiple IP addresses may prefer to use those that have a corresponding PTR record (reverse DNS entry)
						associated with them for outbound mail transfers. This should usually be set to the same value as the <code>announce</code>
						option.
