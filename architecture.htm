				</li>
				<li>
					Opening well researched issues on Github (e.g. against the <a href="https://github.com/cmail-mta/homepage/issues">homepage</a>

			<h2>Development tooling</h2>
			cmail uses a variety of tools to help maintain code quality,
			automate tasks and aid development.
			
			<p>
				At the most basic level, this means cmail is regularly built
				and checked for compile-time warnings using a variety of compilers, 
				and operating systems, including
				<ul>
					<li>gcc</li>
					<li>clang</li>
					<li>tcc</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Code quality is regularly being analyzed by
				<ul>
					<li>
						Running development test builds within <a href="http://valgrind.org/">
						<code>valgrind</code></a> to check for access violations and memory leaks 
						at run-time (invoked via <code>make run</code>)
					</li>
					<li>
						Running <code><a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/">cppcheck</a></code>
						to gather a quick list of warnings from the source (via <code>make cppcheck</code>)
					</li>
					<li>
						Using clangs <code><a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html">scan-build</a></code>
						static analyzer to generate warnings from the source (invoked via <code>scan-build make</code>)
					</li>
					<li>
						Scanning builds with the free offer of the <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a>
						static analyzer solution (<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/5438">Coverity Scan</a>)
					</li>
					<li>
						Stress-testing selected interfaces with fuzzers (eg. 
						<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">afl-fuzz</a>, further information about
						how to invoke fuzzing are in the works)
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Testing & Test Coverage</h2>
			cmail features a growing suite of automated tests, written mostly in <a href="http://tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> using the
			<a href="http://expect.sf.net/">Expect</a> toolkit. In order to run them, you'll need a complete installation of cmail
			which is <strong>NOT</strong> in production use, as the test suite will heavily modify and overwrite any existing configuration
			in order to exercise different parts of the code. Running the suite on a dedicated VM is probably the best way to proceed.
			<p>
			Coverage information can be extracted by running the test suite against a build with the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">gcov</a> 
			coverage analyzer enabled and thereafter analyzing the output with <a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php">lcov</a>.
			As these steps need to assume a lot about the environment they are run in, there is as of yet no completely automated way of running the
			test suite.
			</p>
			<h3>Coverage reports</h3>
			You can view generated coverage reports, which will be updated at irregular intervals.
			<ul>

			<h2>Generating Callgraphs</h2>
			Call graphs are a visual representation of the architecture and are tremendously helpful in understanding
			code and control flow in projects. This makes them highly useful to newcomers for gaining a high-level understanding
			of how a project works, as well as to seasoned developers wanting to visualize how best to fit a particular feature
			into the exisiting architecture.
			<p>
			The cmail main makefile contains a special target named <code>rtldumps</code> which
			generates GCC rtldump files into the <code>rtldumps/</code> folder. These can be used to easily create call graphs
			for all the cmail daemons with the help of <a href="https://github.com/cbdevnet/rtl2dot">rtl2dot</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			For example, to create a graph of the call hierarchy of cmail-smtpd, perform the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>
					In your cmail repository clone, run <code class="command">make rtldumps</code>. 
					This will create a folder named <code>rtldumps</code>, containing the raw data for the graph.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the <code>rtldumps</code> folder, locate the file containing the smtpd data. It will
					usually be named something like <code>smtpd.c.170r.expand</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the graph data for feeding into GraphViz with 
					<code class="command">rtl2dot.py smtpd.c.170r.expand &gt; smtpd.dot</code>. This will create <code>smtpd.dot</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the final image with GraphViz by running <code class="command">dot -Tsvg smtpd.dot &gt; smtpd.svg</code>.
					This will create an SVG image of the call graph. Note that <code>dot</code> is also able to
					create raster images in formats like PNG and JPG by supplying the appropriate -T&lt;type&gt; parameters.
				</li>
			</ol>
			The latter steps can also be automated by pipelining the commands like so:
			<code class="block">rtl2dot.py smtpd.c.170r.expand | dot -Tsvg &gt; smtpd.svg</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			The previous steps generate a full callgraph, containing all functions called via any one possible path from <code>main</code>.
			This includes common functions such as <code>logprintf</code>, which are called from almost every function, eg. to print 
			messages to the log files, as well as library functions which are not directly part of the project.
			<p>
			</p>
			In order to create a clearer visualisation of interesting code paths, it is necessary to exclude some functions from the graph.
			<code>rtl2dot.py</code> supports exclusion of functions by their name with the <code>--ignore</code> argument,
			as well as exclusion of library calls with the <code>--local</code> argument. A beautified callgraph can thus be
			created by running <code class="block">rtl2dot.py smtpd.c.170r.expand --root core_loop --ignore "client_send|logprintf|common_*"
			--local | dot -Tsvg &gt; smtpd.svg</code> This also sets the root function of the graph to <code>core_loop</code>,
			which is where the main processing functions are called in the cmail daemons.
